function CreateBTConfigWrap(specifiedName)
% CreateBTConfigWrap has been removed. Recommendation is to upgrade the
% legacy block using AutomateMask.CreateClassdefBlockAndWrapInsideLegacy
% instead. Note that if you are stuck using somebody else's block that
% hasn't been upgraded yet, you might consider creating a rogue
% classdef-mask wrapper around their block using AutomateMask.DeprecatedLegacyWrapInClassdef
