classdef $(PREFIX)$(SUFFIX) < TuneConfigClass
% $(FILENAME) Default TuneVar values for $(PREFIX) block
% Note that this class does *NOT* have the ablity to Validate, but it can
% lock and default property values. Do not create a Validate method here!
%.This is because TuneVar values must be validated by their translations
%.instead of by build-time logic. During tunings or data builds, only the
%.translation code (in a DLL) is available to ensure the TuneVars are good.
%.TuneVars are inherently variable size, but their maximum dimensions are
%.set by either their build-time default value, or explicitly set in the
%.TuneVar block (TuneTOPs only support automatic size from default value).
% This class simply holds startup values for TuneVars that are used during 
% simulation or translated into TOPs and built into the generated code.
%.To calculate default values using multiple properties, use anonymous
%.functions in a call to Default in this constructor.
%.e.g. the provided default value will start with @().
%.Usage:
%. The BTConfig.AddAllTuneVars method automates the addition of properties 
%.for this class by parsing the Simulink canvas content.
